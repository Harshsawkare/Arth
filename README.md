üé® Key Design Decisions Made
- Dark and Light Themes: Dynamically switchable themes to enhance user experience and accessibility.

- Contrasting Colors: Carefully selected to maintain readability across light and dark modes.

- Search History Visibility: Recent search keywords are shown instantly as chips to speed up repeated queries.

- Empty State UI: A clean placeholder UI is shown when the search list is empty, encouraging the user to perform a search.

- Offline Caching: Results of the latest 5 successful online search queries are cached locally and can be accessed without internet.

- Pagination: Supports infinite scroll with load-more functionality for large result sets.

‚öôÔ∏è Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Network Detection in Release Mode:

  - Issue: ConnectivityService returned false in release mode.

  - Fix: Added both INTERNET and ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE permissions in AndroidManifest.xml and initialized internet check immediately on service start.

- Search Result Persistence:

  - Solution: Used Hive to store results locally per keyword to allow reuse of previously fetched content.
  - Challenge Faced: Initially, keywords were not stored with timestamps. This caused incorrect keywords to be deleted when enforcing the limit of 5 recent searches, as there was no way to identify which one was oldest.
  - Fix: Implemented timestamp-based tracking for each keyword entry, allowing precise deletion of the oldest keyword when a new one is added.

- Efficient UI Updates:

  - Handled with Obx and GetX to make only necessary parts reactive, improving performance and avoiding rebuilds.

üß© Known Issues / Areas for Improvement
- No Clear Error UI:

  - Network or API errors are only shown via snackbars. A better error page or retry button could enhance UX.

- Search API Rate Limit:

  - NewsAPI‚Äôs free tier has a request limit. Handling for rate-limit errors could be improved.
